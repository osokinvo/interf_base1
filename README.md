# interf_base1
The project contains a small script to create an image of the color of the film depending on its thickness when three monochromatic lights interfere. The calculation is a first approximation and is necessary to evaluate the simplified model.
Parameters such as reflection coefficients at the air-film and metal film interfaces were also changed.
The calculated model turned out to be far from reality and will be changed. These color combinations are not observed on oxide films of stainless steel and titanium.
